			<p>The seas are the origin of life and continued sources of its survival. Clerics of the Sea Domain worship the way in which the waters and the moon that create tides bathe the land in life. They seek to protect its fragile reefs and revere its tempestuous nature. Following gods of water, the ocean, and the seas, such as Aegir, Brigantia, Manannan mac Lir, Njord, Poseidon, and Sobek, these clerics adventure on ships, below the waves, and across coasts in order to spread liveliness, find sunken artifacts, and see the vastness of the oceans to strengthen their worship.</p>
			<h4>Domain Spells</h4>
			<p><i>1st-level Sea Domain feature</i></p>
			<p>You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Sea Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.</p>

Each creature other than you within the moon's light when you use this action must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pulled to the nearest unoccupied space next to the moon, have its speed reduced to 0, and travel with the moon for the duration. A creature can choose to fail this saving throw. If the creature is in the moon's bright light, it makes its saving throw with disadvantage.</p>
