			<p>The song of the sea bewitches and mesmerizes. Its waves provide melody; its storms play torment upon its travelers. Bards of the College of Sirens harness the ancient wisdom of the seas and spin it into performances that captivate. They specialize in shanties and hypnotic stories of beauty and violence, charm and fear, depths and shallows.</p>
