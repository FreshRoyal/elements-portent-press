		<description>
			<p>The Oath of Sophistication binds paladins to protect the value of high society, material possessions, and once-in-a-life-time opportunities. Though they are often called vain, sometimes even by other paladins, these paladins are not necessarily obsessed with their place in the things they protect. They recognize the importance of high society's continuation and the means by which it can be made available to all.</p>
			<p class="indent">More than perhaps any other oath, the oath of sophistication encourages its paladins to be charitable, critical of wasted opportunity, and careful with their words and intentions.</p>

			<h4>Tenets of Sophistication</h4>
			<p>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Sophistication vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Charitable.</b> No matter their station in life, others can always benefit from help. Be ever willing to lend aid to those who need it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Charming.</b> To be sophisticated is to charm.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Decisive.</b> Opportunities and experience flit through life often but once. Be ready to embrace the unexpected.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Intentional.</b> Sophistication begets observation. Speak and act always as if someone watches.</p>
