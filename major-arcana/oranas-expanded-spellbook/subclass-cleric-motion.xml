			<p>The act of motion is performed by all living things, one of the base signs of life itself, and it has many manifestations. The gods of motion inspire their followers to recognize how all motion can cause further motion in other creatures or objects, to see how all is connected through even the smallest actions.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many of these clerics never stop moving, by means of constant traveling and sometimes being incapable of sitting still. While others are careful with their movements, only being in motion when they believe they understand what impacts their movement will have.</p>
