			<p>Protecting the boundary between the settled areas of the world and the wilds requires watchers from both sides of the palisade. Polis sweepers consider cities to be ecosystems all their own, with food chains to respect and imbalances to correct. They listen to the city's whispers to find their way and will cut out parts of it that are killing the whole - whether that means offing a corrupt official or burning an abandoned building that's a den for plague rats.</p>

			<p>Over the course of one minute, you can choose up to three willing creatures within 5 feet of you, making you and each of those creatures conspirators. On your turn while a conspirator is within 5 feet of you (no action required), you can use subtle magics to monitor and imperil a creature you can see within 30 feet of you: your mark.</p>
			<p class="indent">Until you use this feature again, each conspirator gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy against the mark. Once per turn, when a conspirator hits the mark with an attack, it can force the mark to suffer one of the following effects. Conspirators can't force a mark to suffer the same effect twice in a row during the same round in combat.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The attack puts it off-kilter. It has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.</li>
				<li>The attack dazes the creature, which can't take reactions until the end of its next turn.</li>
				<li>The attack hits a vulnerable area, dealing an additional 1d4 damage. This damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level and 1d8 at 14th level.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">You can choose a mark twice, regaining expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
