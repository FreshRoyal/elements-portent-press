			<p>Bards of the College of Puppetry are master manipulators, individuals who revel in the subtlety of their art. While other bards might enjoy the applause of their audiences or the respect of their peers, these puppeteers enjoy being the guiding hand, the shadow behind the curtain.</p>
			<p class="indent">Bards of this college gather like others, but typically only to hold grand competitions or induct new members into their illustrious numbers. Each bard will play a performance, hoping to establish themselves as a master puppeteer. Joint performances are not unheard of, but they are rare, a result of their solitary mindsets.</p>
			<p class="indent">Their goals are varied, but they often involve pushing and pulling the right people into the right places at the right times. Carefully orchestrated, their masterpiece is perfect only when no one is even aware of its existence. Whether the result be the upheaval of an age or a simple heist, the delight is in the craft itself.</p>

			<p>Your skill with puppetry transcends the physical. You can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make that involve puppets, and you learn the stroke of lunacy cantrip. If you already know it, you instead learn one bard cantrip of your choice.</p>
			<p class="indent">Also, when a hostile creature within 30 feet of you that you can see fails its saving throw against one of your spells, you can expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration to make it your puppet. The effect lasts until the spell ends, until 1 minute passes, or until the creature is further than 60 feet away from you. Translucent strings connect its limbs to yours for the duration, and whenever the creature makes an attack roll or ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a Bardic Inspiration die and apply the result to the roll as a penalty or bonus. You don't expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration when you roll the die in this way.</p>

			<p>When a creature fails its saving throw against one of your bard spells or features, you learn its surface thoughts as if by the detect thoughts spell until the end of your next turn. Additionally, as an action, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be convinced one of the following is true (your choice each time you use this feature):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Someone just called out to it, using its name if it has one. You choose the general intent of the message, and the sound originates from a location of your choice within 30 feet of the creature, even behind an object or structure.</li>
				<li>Something just touched it. You choose the sensation, although it must be harmless.</li>
				<li>Something just moved. The visual phenomenon is too fast to make out detail, and it must fit within a 5 foot cube. It appears at a location of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the creature, or the closest location to it that the creature can see.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">A creature that succeeds on its saving throw against this feature is immune to its effects for 24 hours. A creature that fails its saving throw against this feature has disadvantage on subsequent saving throws it makes against it for the next minute.</p>

			<p>When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature, you can puppeteer a creature to your or its benefit. Either the target of your Bardic Inspiration or a creature you can see under the effects of one of your spells immediately uses its reaction to move up to its speed and make a single weapon attack or cast a cantrip. You choose the target of the attack or cantrip, although you can't force a creature to harm itself. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC to avoid this effect, and the creature doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit.</p>
