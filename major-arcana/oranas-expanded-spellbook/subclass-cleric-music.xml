			<p>Music is a staple of cultures and civilizations across the multiverse, a rhythm and melody that brings joy, sorrow, and every emotion in between. The gods of music—including Lugh, Apollo, Dionysus, Bes, and Balder—value the range of impacts music has on all creatures, even those that don't or can't recognize the mathematics, order, and science that establish its songs.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many of these gods also recognize the importance of discordance within the domain. They understand that music isn't and shouldn't always be pleasing, that in cacophony there is meaning and in that meaning emotion. Clerics of the music domain spread this message, sometimes in hymns, and other times in chaotic rabble.</p>

The ambient music lingers for a number of hours equal to half your cleric level (rounded up), and while it lingers, the creature's movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, it can travel at a fast pace without suffering a penalty to its passive Perception, it has advantage on saving throws to avoid exhaustion, and it can add a d4 to saving throws it makes that use an ability score of your choice.</p>
