Sonorants-at-Arms infuse the very sounds of combat with the powers commanded by bards. Their musical talents extend to and magical, primarily that of mental manipulation: a Sonorants-at-Arms' songs bolster their allies and bind the psyches of those that would oppose them.</p>

			<p>You augment your martial prowess with bardic magic.</p>
			<h5>Cantrips</h5>
			<p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn an additional bard cantrip at 10th level.</p>
			<h5>Spell Slots</h5>
			<p>The Sonorant-at-Arms Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.</p>
			<h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>
			<p>You know three 1st-level bard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the bard spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Sonorant-at-Arms Spellcasting table shows when you learn more bard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the bard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the bard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>
			<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>
			<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells, since you project your spells through dramtic flair in comabat. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><b>Spell Save DC =</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
				<p><b>Spell attack modifier =</b> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
