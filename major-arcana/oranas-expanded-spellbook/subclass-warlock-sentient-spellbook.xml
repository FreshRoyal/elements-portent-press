			<p>There are many ways to animate and awaken that which is insentient or insapient: <i>wish</i> spells, spells that animate, and more esoteric means. In the case of spellbooks, there is even the possibility that the gathering of so much magic into one item can alter its reality, giving it life.</p>
			<p class="indent">Regardless of how your patron was created, you have formed a pact with a living spellbook. The being's motivations may be as varied as the spells within its pages, or as straightforward as a simple desire for the knowledge or means to free other objects from insentient boredom.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Your patron reveals the secrets of written magic. You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you don't already have it. In addition, when you use a spell scroll, the written spell is always considered on the warlock spell list for you. If you use a spell scroll to cast a spell of a higher level than you can normally cast, you add your proficiency bonus to the check made to do so.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can also script magic into your body, much like a living spellbook yourself. Over the course of a long rest, you can script a magical glyph or string of arcane equations onto the surface of your body or a piece of parchment. When you do so, choose a warlock spell that you know. While the script remains, you can cast that spell at its lowest level once without expending a spell slot or material components, causing the script to burn away.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can only have one spell written in this way at a time. When you reach 10th level, you can script a second spell, but it must be of 3rd-level or lower.</p>
