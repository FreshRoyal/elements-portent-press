				<p>Your patron is a being that sees into what is meant to be unseen and beyond, a creature that sees through time and, perhaps, into different realms. Usually, these entities are entirely mysterious, able to avoid detection and understanding, as they can always see the attempts coming and avoid them.</p>
				<p class="indent">This being’s motivations and plans will often be impossible to fully understand until they come to fruition, as they act to set up the pieces to reach a specific future that they can see. Those who make pacts with these mystifying patrons often wish to gain the knowledge needed to forge their own fate or to change a destiny they don’t wish to be dealt.</p>
